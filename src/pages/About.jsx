        <p className='about-text'>This app helps students quickly review their syllabi by highlighting key points that require further research. It is designed to save students time by providing a streamlined way to review course material, while also helping students to better understand the material they are learning. The app allows users to quickly view the syllabi of their courses, and then provides an analysis of the syllabus with key points and questions that might require further research. This allows students to focus on the most important points of the syllabus and better prioritize their studies. Additionally, the app provides students with resources to help them further investigate topics within their courses, such as links to articles and other helpful websites.</p>
